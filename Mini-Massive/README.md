<h1 align="center">Mini-Massive</h1>

<p align="center">
A lightweight, open-source framework for agent-based simulations.  <br>
Inspired by Weta Digital’s Massive - used in The Lord of the Rings <br>
  <br>
Mini-Massive lets you create swarms, crowds, traffic flows, and cinematic cavalry charges with rule-driven agents, reproducible runs, and lightweight visualization. Designed to scale from hundreds to thousands of autonomous agents, Mini-Massive reimagines the power of *Massive* for open source.

## Features  
- **Rule-driven agents** — design behaviors using fuzzy logic or behavior trees.  
- **Scalable simulation** — run hundreds to thousands of agents in real time.  
- **Reproducible runs** — deterministic seeding for consistent experiments.  
- **Lightweight visualization** — export animations, JSON logs, or live 2D/3D views.  
- **Flexible scenarios** — model crowds, traffic, swarms, herds, or battles.
